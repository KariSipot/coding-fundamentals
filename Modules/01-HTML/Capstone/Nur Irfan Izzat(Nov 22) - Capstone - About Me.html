            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                Persistance & preserverance. That is how i would describe my self. Graduated at UiTM Shah Alam in Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 2015, I have the basic skill and knowledge in programming.
                After graduating, i decided not to pursue my career in IT and instead I went for F&B. As much as it is a very different field, let me explain why i went to F&B.

                Food and beverages has been the field that I am interested most among other field. It has been since i was 17 years old. Most people would look at the money in FnB but rather than that, I look for the adventure.
                As soon as I finish my study, I went to work with Sushi King MY for about 2 years. My main objective working there is to understand how a  chain-restaurant work. Started as a kitchen crew, I learned how to manage the kitchen
                from cleaning, ordering, arrange kitchen items, knife and cooking skills. After around 4 months, I was promoted to Junior Cook. 

                At this point, District Managers have come to me and explain that having a degree can give me a much better position and pay in the restaurant. As much as i understand that, if I was to be promoted at that time, I wouldnt be able to understand
                how the full process of a restaurant from managing orders from customer until the customers have left. During this time, I would take the oppurtunity to help my Managers, assistant managers, district manager,head cook, chief cook and district Cook
                so that I would understand their jobscope and help them solves their problems.

                After 2 years, I decided to quit from Sushi King and start my own business, <a href="https://twitter.com/PotD_AK" target="_blank">Pot D</a>. My customer target would be office workers during lunch. By cooking and delivering them myselves, I have been able
                to achieve sales of around RM 5000 per month. My working hours would be from 4 AM until 4 PM.

                In 2021, My wife and I decided to open up our own restaurant called Restoran Tok Umi in Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam.

                I have achieved my dream of opening and operating a restaurant. I have given full responsibility and credit to my wife. Now, I am eager to use my degree in IT field.
